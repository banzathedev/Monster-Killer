## Monster-Killer

```
This was a basic browser "game" i've done in mine vuejs2 studies
the ui its very simple, but the game works well, the focus here was use, HTML, JS and CSS and make a game
i do not intend to work more on this game because, my expectations are accomplished, but i have other projects with more complex UI/CSS or style, if want, be my guest to look.

```

## Project setup 

```
That is very simple, to play the game you have two options, you can clone the repository or download the files, in any case you will face yourself with two files, notice bouth files have what language they are, select wich one u prefer, then double click index.html and play =3
